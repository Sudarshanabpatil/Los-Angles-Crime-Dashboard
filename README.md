I'm excited to share my Power Bi project where I analyzed and visualized the "Loas Angels Crime Data"! 📊

📌 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰 :-
We conducted an in-depth analysis for Crime Data using Power BI, aiming to create visually appealing and easy-to-understand dashboards. These dashboards highlight Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help the client make informed decisions and drive business growth.

📌 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 :-
I provided a thorough examination of the client’s KPIs, designed intuitive dashboards with Power BI, presented actionable insights from the Crime data, and ensured the dashboards are easy to understand for non-technical users.

📌 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 :-
▪ Total Crimes vs. Crime Category
▪ Total Crimes vs Vict Age and no of Investigations
▪ Total Crimes by Crime Location
▪ Total Crimes and Avg Vict Age by Year
▪ Total Crimes by Crime Severity Category

📌 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 :-
This conclusion offers actionable insights that can help decision-makers prioritize areas for intervention, optimize resources, and design more effective crime prevention strategies:

▪Crime Rates by Location
▪Types of Crimes
▪Crime Trends Over Time
▪Demographic Impact
▪Predictive Insights

These recommendations are designed to help the Los Angels Crime Department leverage its strengths, address areas for improvement, and remain competitive. Implementing these strategies will drive substantial growth and reduces the Crime Rate. 🌟
